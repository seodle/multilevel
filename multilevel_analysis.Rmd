## Variables

* **Post_QoL**:	This	is	a	measure	of	quality	of	life	after	the	cosmetic	surgery.
This	is	our	outcome	variable.
* **Base_QoL**:	 We	 need	 to	 adjust	 our	 outcome	 for	 quality	 of	 life	 before	 the
surgery.
* **Surgery**:	 This	 variable	 is	 a	 dummy	 variable	 that	 specifies	 whether	 the
person	 has	 undergone	 cosmetic	 surgery	 (1)	 or	 whether	 they	 are	 on	 the
waiting	list	(0),	which	acts	as	our	control	group.
* **Surgery_Text**:	 This	 variable	 is	 the	 same	 as	 above	 but	 specifies	 group
membership	as	text	(we	will	use	this	variable	when	we	create	graphs	but
not	for	the	main	analysis).
* **Clinic**:	This	variable	specifies	which	of	10	clinics	the	person	attended	to
have	their	surgery.
* **Age**:	This	variable	tells	us	the	personâ€™s	age	in	years.
* **BDI**:	 It	 is	 becoming	 increasingly	 apparent	 that	 people	 volunteering	 for
cosmetic	surgery	(especially	when	the	surgery	is	purely	for	vanity)	might
have	 very	 different	 personality	 profiles	 than	 the	 general	 public	 (Cook,
Rossera,	Toone,	James,	&	Salmon,	2006).	In	particular,	these	people	might
have	low	self-esteem	or	be	depressed.	When	looking	at	quality	of	life	it	is
important	to	assess	natural	levels	of	depression,	and	this	variable	used	the
Beck	Depression	Inventory	(BDI)	to	do	just	that.
* **Reason**:	This	dummy	variable	specifies	whether	the	person	had/is	waiting
to	 have	 surgery	 purely	 to	 change	 their	 appearance	 (0),	 or	 because	 of	 a
physical	reason	(1).
